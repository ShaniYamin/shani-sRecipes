          <p>Hey <br/>
            My name is Shani, I graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer science. <br/>
            Looking to learn and expand my knowledge in the field of software development mainly in the backend. <br/>
            I am neither a chef nor a confectioner, but someone who knows how to prepare delicious food ðŸ™‚ <br/>
            I acquired most of my knowledge mainly from experience in the kitchen and I'm still learning, all the time. <br/>
            I like to improvise and surprise (sometimes even myself). <br/>
            Hope you enjoy the site and learn that to prepare delicious food you don't have to work hard.
            </p>
