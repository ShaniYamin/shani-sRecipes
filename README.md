# Shani's Recipes

Welcome to Shani's Recipes, a delightful journey into the world of culinary delights! I'm Shani, the creator of this recipe website, and I'm excited to share with you the architecture and technologies behind this project.

## Tech Stack

1. **Frontend: React**
   - Shani's Recipes boasts a sleek and responsive user interface developed using React. The modern and dynamic nature of React allows for an interactive and user-friendly experience, making it easy for users to explore and discover delicious recipes.

2. **Backend: Django**
   - Powering the server-side of our application is Django, a high-level Python web framework. With Django, we've built a robust backend that handles user authentication, recipe storage, and various other functionalities. Django's "batteries-included" philosophy ensures a scalable and maintainable backend.

3. **Database: MySQL**
   - The heart of our recipe storage system is MySQL, a reliable relational database management system. It efficiently organizes and retrieves recipe data, ensuring a seamless experience for users as they browse, search, and save their favorite recipes.

4. **Custom API: Seamless Communication**
   - To facilitate seamless communication between the frontend and backend components, we've implemented a custom API. This API acts as a bridge, ensuring that data flows smoothly between the user interface and the server, allowing for real-time updates and interactions.

## Project Repositories
